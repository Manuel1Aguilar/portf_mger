# Stock Tracker project

This project is based on the quote by Charlie Munger:
â€œIf all you ever did was buy high-quality stocks on the 200-week moving average, you would beat the S&P 500 by a large margin over time.
The problem is, few human beings have that kind of discipline."

So the functionalities are:

- Search for stocks by symbol (Get current price and 200-week MA)
- Add stock to list of followed stocks (Stock + intended % of portfolio)
- Alert when a stock should be bought
- Save stock buys/sells. Keep record of the portfolio

Initially it will be a CLI. There's space to think about doing a web-page and mobile app from this.
